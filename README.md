Expense Tracker PRO appears to be a web application for tracking personal finances, allowing users to monitor their income and expenses. The project uses a stack including Express, Node.js, and MongoDB for the backend.
Key Features:

User Authentication:

The system implements user registration and login functionality.
It uses token-based authentication (likely JWT) for securing routes and user sessions.

Protected Routes:

Certain routes, including the main dashboard and transaction management, are protected and require authentication.

User Dashboard:

After successful login, users are directed to a dashboard.
The dashboard shows the user's balance and recent transactions.

Transaction Management:

Users can add both income and expenses.
The system tracks and categorizes transactions.

Public vs Protected Routes:

Login and registration are public routes.
The main functionality (dashboard, adding transactions) is protected.

Technical Implementation:

Backend Architecture:

Uses Express.js for routing and API endpoints.
Node.js as the runtime environment.
MongoDB for database storage.

Authentication Flow:

Upon successful login, an access token is generated.
This token is then checked by an Auth Checker middleware for protected routes.
The token contains user information (ID, name, location).

RESTful API:

Likely implements RESTful principles for handling CRUD operations on transactions.

Security:

Implements route protection to ensure data privacy and user-specific access.
